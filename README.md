 
Adata Automation Framework
--------------------------

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/adata/badge/?version=latest)](http://adata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**Adata** is a cross-platform python automation framework, focused on data, connections and "If This Then That" event handling.

The purpose is to have a portable enviroment to quickly deploy custom python scripts anywhere, with the power of the WX Phoenix graphic user interface.

Highlighs:

* A publisher / subscriber event handling system.
* A Twisted internet reactor ready to serve.
* Packages preinstalled in a portable frozen enviroment.


You can deploy small services like a websocket server pushing data to "remote control" web applications, and connect MQTT devices, log to a database... it is python with some batteries.

I needed a portable platform to maintain the Python scripts that I do for my clients that normally only have a bad Windows PC and a mobile.
